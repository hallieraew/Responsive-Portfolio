            <p class ="about1">Hello! I am Hallie Weintraub, Quality Assurance Engineer. I participate on a team of developers who ensure our participant experience is a great one. I test across three platforms, our web, iOS and Android devices. I have recently entered the tech field after spending much of my life in customer service. Prior to finding my current company, I had opened a restaurant with my mom in New Glarus, Wisconsin. The restaurant is still up and running but I only jump in the kitchen from time to time.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="about2">I am originally from Olympia, Washington, they call us greeners. I loved living in the trees and near the ocean. I hope to return to the Pacific Northwest one day, but for now I love the rolling hills of SW Wisconsin. I lived all over and being in a city was nice, but I really do not think you can beat the "Wisconsin nice" of the people here. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="about2">In my spare time, I like to hang out with my two cats, have good drinks and eat good food. In the spring I play softball with a group of really great gals on the east side of Madison.</p>
